<h4 align="center">An application for a management agency, developed using the Java language. This application utilizes Java Swing for the development of the interface, and Hibernate as the framework for interacting with the MySQL database. The application follows the Model-View-Controller architecture and supports asynchronous operations using CompletableFuture, enhancing performance and responsiveness by handling database interactions and other background tasks without blocking the user interface.</h4>

## <div align="center">JAVA SWING</div>

[![swing.png](https://i.postimg.cc/mkXZhD3C/swing.png)](https://postimg.cc/LgPFbmb8)

<h4 align="center">For the development of the interface, I used Java Swing and the editor provided by the NetBeans IDE. The interface offers a wide range of options to the user, such as viewing data, adding new data, updating existing data, deleting existing data, and providing ease of searching for existing data.</h4>

## <div align="center">HIBERNATE</div>

[![hbernate.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Pr2x3d7B/hbernate.png)](https://postimg.cc/WhqTtcTn)

<h4 align="center">The application uses the Hibernate framework to connect the app to the database, facilitating class mapping and making it easier to perform database queries.</h4>

## <div align="center">MYSQL</div>

<h4 align="center">The application uses the Model-View-Controller architecture, which will allow for better organization and scalability for future updates.</h4>

## <div align="center">COMPLETABLE FUTURE</div>

[![Async.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Pxck1KYn/Async.png)](https://postimg.cc/9RGShdLL)

<h4 align="center">This application leverages Java's CompletableFuture class to implement asynchronous operations, allowing intensive tasks such as database interactions to run in the background. This significantly improves the responsiveness of the user interface built with Java Swing by preventing blocking and providing a smoother user experience. Thanks to this asynchronous architecture, the application can handle multiple processes concurrently, optimizing performance without compromising the simplicity of the MVC-based design.</h4>
